This FlashCore module (which actually isn't a true module as it edits a small part of Flashcord and doesn't use any @containers) is extremely simple, it adds a very small piece of code which forces every message to be able to contain a chat effect.

By default, ever since Flashcord Beta, it only allows the last 8 messages to be able to have a working chat effect, this removes the limit entirely, at the cost of obviously, probably and maybe severe performance issues.
