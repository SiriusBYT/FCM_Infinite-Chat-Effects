# This is a modified version of the Replugged Template.
See the [theme development guide](https://guide.replugged.dev/docs/themes/getting-started) for more information on how to get it to produce a valid ASAR file.

## Welcome to the Flashcord Module Template!
This is a simple modification in which the main.css file has been edited to have most FlashCore modules ready to be edited.

Please make sure that the ID of your module contains "FCM" so that it can be distinguised from regular themes.

An image is required to be uploaded for the [Flashcord Module Store](https://sirio-network.com/flashcord/store), name it something simple like "banner" or "store image".

#### ⚠️ Please refrain from sending Flashcord Modules for approval on the Replugged store, it's best not flooding their theme page with Flashcord.
Also while I won't stop you for making Vencord or BetterDiscord versions, I will not link them on the Module Store.
